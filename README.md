# GenMind-Spark ⚡

GenMind-Spark is a little experiment to bring ideas to life using *TypeScript, **Vite, and **Tailwind CSS*.  
Think of it as a playground where clean code meets clean design.

## ✨ What’s inside?

- ⚡ Super fast dev setup with *Vite*  
- 🎨 Styled with *Tailwind CSS* (so no wrestling with CSS files)  
- 🔒 Written in *TypeScript* (because type safety = peace of mind)  
- 🧩 Modular structure that’s easy to hack on  

Basically, it’s a modern frontend starter kit that you can build on.
